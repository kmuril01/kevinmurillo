Organizational Text Formatting
Headers
Note: Don’t forget to add a space between the leading heading character (#, ##, ###) and your text!
To create a header you just need to include a specific number of the hash/pound sign character (#). Use (#) for a big header, (##) for a smaller header, or (###) for an even smaller header as the first character(s) in a new line to make a header. Here is an example of what each header type looks like.
# Header 1 no formatting
## Header 2 no formatting
### Header 3 no formatting
# **Header 1 - Bold**
## **Header 2 - Bold**
### **Header 3 - Bold**
# *Header 1 - Italics*
## *Header 2 - Italics*
### *Header 3 - Italics*

Subtext
Like Headers, you can add subtext to any chat message. To do so, add a (-# ) before the text you want to appear in the subtext. Don’t forget the space after # before your message. For example: 
-# Subtext
Subtext works very similarly to Headers, so the (-#) must be at the very beginning of the line in order for it to work.

Lists
Note: Don’t forget to add a space between the list bullet (-, *, 1., etc) and your text!
You can create a bulleted list using either (-) or (*) in the beginning of each line. For example:
- Bullets
- Bullets
- Bullets
- ✨Magic ✨
* Another way for way Bullets
* Another one
* Another one
1. Or Another One
2. Or Another One
3. Or Another One
You can also indent your list by adding 2 spaces before (-) or (*) at the beginning of each line. For example:
- Bullets
  - indent 1
* Another way for way Bullets
  * Another one
1. Or Another One
  a. Or Another One

Code Blocks
You can make your own code blocks by wrapping your text in backticks (`). 
`Code Block Text`

If you want to create a multi-line code block, you can do so by wrapping your text in (```), like this beautifully written haiku.
```Rubba Dub Dub Thanks for the Grub```

```sh
Code box in list form
Code box row 2
Code box row 3
```

```diff
Code Box with colors
+Green
-red
```
Block Quotes
Note: Don’t forget to add a space between the leading > and your text!
Another option is using block quotes. To use a block quote, you just need to put (>) at the beginning of a line of text to create a single block quote. For example:
>>> Tea
Coffee
Soda
Water
Sparkling Water

Masked links
You can use masked links to make text a clickable or pressable hyperlink. To do so, you need to include the text you want displayed in brackets and then the URL in parentheses. For example:
[This is google](https://ggogle.com)
